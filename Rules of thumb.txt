Number of training points needed - 10*dvc
Learning rate for stochastic gradient descent - 0.1
Data for validation - N/2 (20%)
V-fold cross validation - 10 validation sets
Useful practical guideline - 3 nearest neighbors is usually enough
Effective choice for radius (r) in window kernel is (N^(1/(2d)))^-1 ~ k = sqrt(N)
