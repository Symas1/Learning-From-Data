Hyperplane is expressed as w = sum yn aplhan xn
From formula above if some Larangian multiplier is zero then corresponding x does not affect the hyperplane
It means that corresponding x (point) doesn't support our hyperplane and lies somewhere in space and so
y (w.Tx + b) > 1
And for support vectors (points) y (w.Txs +b) == 1
