(b)
Max depth in case of all sub-clusters being of equal size = O(logN)

(c)
In case when bound condition always holds, at every iteration we should only make sure that inequality
||x-mu1||+r1 <= ||x-mu2||-r2 holds this takes O(d) time - dimension of x and we have O(logN) such iterations, so total = 
O(dlogN)

(d) To find k nearest neighbors we would need to stop the algorithm with clusters of size > 1
